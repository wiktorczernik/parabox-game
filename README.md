# PARA/BOX

A singleplayer puzzle-solving FPS game built using Unity.

```
Another day, another dollar earned in the Skala INC. warehouse. 

The Para company delivered the next batch of Para/Boxes. 

Day like every day, until a mysterious figure caused one of the employees to vanish.

Find your way as a lost worker and get out of this place.
